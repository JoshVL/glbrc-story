# GLBRC Story - READ ME

This is my initial setup of this story/assignment. On a bit of a time crunch and learning this new tech stack, so my documentation may be limited. Sorry if this is not complete. Either way, it was a good way to learn how Ruby on Rails works.

**Getting Started:**

To run this program off of local host, you must have Ruby installed locally. Then run the following command in the root directory of this project:

> `ruby bin/rails server`


`(Note: $ruby may not be needed depending on your system config.)`

This will start the server on `localhost:3000`


**Other Notes**

This stack uses Ruby/Rails, Bootstrap (4.5), HTML, CSS. The SQL db used is SQLite generated from the Ruby on Rails project commands. The test logins should be saved to `seeds.rb` as per the story write up.
